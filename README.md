# ReactPY-starter

This is the ReactPY version of a example ReactJS project.
(see "github.com/frickc3/reactjs-starter" for the JS version of this project).

It was created to determine what the effort was to change to ReactPY from Reactjs.

Standard, setup virtual environment in Python, pip install -r requirements.txt, then python main.py.
